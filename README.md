## Inspiration
I have built this website to make event organizing more efficient and accessible for everyone. Many event organizers face challenges in finding sponsorship details, staying up-to-date on upcoming events, and accessing resources to help improve their planning process. By creating a platform that brings all of these tools and resources together in one place, event organizers can focus more on the creative aspects of event planning and less on the administrative tasks. Additionally, making event organizing more efficient can also help make events more successful and enjoyable for attendees.

## What it does
It provides a variety of tools and resources to make event planning more efficient and effective. Here are some of the key features of the platform.
- Sponsorship Contacts: A comprehensive list of companies and organizations that offer event sponsorships, including information about their sponsorship packages and requirements.
- Upcoming Events: A list of upcoming events, conferences, and trade shows in various industries and regions to help organizers stay up-to-date on what's happening.
- Event Communities: Access to curated list of communities, that helps event organizers to connect with one another, share tips and resources, and collaborate on projects.
Overall, the website should aim to provide a one-stop-shop for event organizers to find the resources and support they need to plan successful events.

`Right Now the data is static, but I will soon add the functionality so that other people can add resources or share their experience or event add community and register for the sponsorships`

## How I built it
- I have used `React` for the frontend and `Nodejs` for the Backend. I have utilized `Tailwind CSS` for beautifying my website like a GitHubüòÅ.  For hosting the website, I have used `netlify` and for Domain, I have used `GoDaddy Domain Registry`.

## Challenges I ran into
- I encountered two issues while working on the project. Firstly, due to an impending exam on Saturday, I was unable to develop a backend for the website. As a workaround, I utilized `static JSON objects` for data retrieval. Secondly, my inexperience with Tailwind CSS posed a challenge, as its class structure and usage differed significantly from that of Bootstrap. However, I sought guidance from a friend and successfully acquired proficiency in Tailwind CSS.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
- I'm particularly proud of this project because I faced a number of challenges while organizing my own hackathon, and I wanted to create a tool that could help other organizers avoid those same challenges.
One of the things I'm most proud of is the research and planning that went into creating the curated lists of contacts. I spent a lot of time researching different communities and sponsorship opportunities to make sure that the lists were comprehensive and up-to-date. Additionally, I'm proud of the design and user interface of the website, which I think makes it easy for event organizers to find the information they need. Overall, I'm proud of the way that Hacksplan turned out and the potential it has to help other event organizers overcome some of the challenges I faced while planning my own hackathon.

## What I learned
- During the hackathon project, I learned a lot about front-end web development. Specifically, I learned how to use Tailwind CSS and its classes to style my web pages. I found that Tailwind CSS is a powerful framework that can help streamline the styling process and make it easier to create consistent and responsive designs. Additionally, I learned how to deploy a website on Netlify and set up DNS for the domain. This was a great opportunity to practice my development skills and learn new tools that I can use in future projects.

## What's next for HacksPlan
- Building a Backend for the Platform so people can come, and give their experiences regarding their event planning.
- Sponsors Registration
- Community Registration
- Curated List of Resources for Event Planning.
